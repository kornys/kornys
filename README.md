## David Kornel
As the Principal Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat, my focus is set squarely on the intersection of innovation and reliability within the Kubernetes/OpenShift environments. With a passion for refining and advancing the quality of software, I lead efforts in rigorously testing Kubernetes operators, ensuring they meet our stringent standards for robustness and performance. My approach is deeply rooted in the automation of testing processes, utilizing cutting-edge tools such as Jenkins pipelines, Tekton, and ArgoCD. This not only enhances efficiency but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement and precision in our software development lifecycle.
